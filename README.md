# Sequential

My attempt at learning processing sequential data: recurrent neural networks (RNNs), time series data and natural language processing.

I am following the Dive Into Deep Learning syllabus (Chapters 8-10) as the primary reference.

In addition to running the code, my attempts on the exercises are included.
