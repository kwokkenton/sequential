# Sequential

My attempt at learning processing sequential data: recurrent neural networks (RNNs), time series data and natural language processing.

I am following the Dive Into Deep Learning syllabus (Chapters 8-10) as the primary reference.

In addition to running the code, my attempts on the exercises are included. 

## Contents
`sequence_model.ipynb`: investigation of using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model to forecast a time series. Looks at an autoregressive model to extrapolate a sinusoid using various k-step ahead models. Main takeaway is that errors accumulate when this happens. Refers to Chapter 8.1 of d2l.ai. 
`text_models.ipynb`: Refers to Chapters 8.2-3 of d2l.ai.
